 __________
</p>
Greenhouse gases are accredited with the depletion of our ozone layer
 and rising global temperatures
 <p>
 _________
 </p>
 The adverse effects of such events would include <strong>water shortages, famine, and dangerous changes to the global landscape</strong> <em>(e.g. - grasslands converted to deserts)</em>

Livestock farming is responsible for <strong>20- to 50-%</strong> of all man-made greenhouse gases

Carbon Dioxide (<em>CO<sup>2</sup></em>) accounts for about <strong>three-fourths</strong> of total greenhouse emissions
<p>
 __________

  Meat-eaters have almost <strong> double </strong> the carbon footprint of vegetarians
  <p>
   __________
 </p>
